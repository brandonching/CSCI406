    \question[20][W13, \stars{2}] We reduced Vertex Cover (VC) to Subset Sum (SS) in class. To illustrate the reduction, we converted
    an instance of the VC problem $\langle{G,k}\rangle$ with graph $G(V,E)$ consisting of $V = \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and $E = \{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\}$
    where $e_0= (0,4)$, $e_1 = (0,3)$, $e_2 =(0,2)$, $e_3 = (0,1)$, and $e_4 = (2,3)$. The following is a representation of $G$ in visual form:

    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node[circle, draw] (0) at (1,1) {0};
        \node[circle, draw] (1) at (0,0) {1};
        \node[circle, draw] (2) at (0,2) {2};
        \node[circle, draw] (3) at (2,2) {3};

    \question[40][W14, \stars{5}]
    Consider the following problems:
    \begin{mdframed}
        \textbf{Subset Sum}

        Given a set of integers $U = \{u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots, u_n\}$ and a target sum $T$, the Subset Sum problem asks whether there exists a subset $S \subseteq U$ such that the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $T$.

        For example, consider the set $U = \{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2\}$ and a target sum $T = 9$. A possible solution is the subset $S = \{4, 5\}$, since the sum of the elements in $S$ is $4 + 5 = 9$, which equals the target sum $T$. The Subset Sum problem determines whether such a subset exists for a given set and target sum.
    \end{mdframed}

    \begin{mdframed}
        \textbf{Set Partition}

        Given a set of integers $U = \{u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots, u_n\}$, the Set Partition problem asks if it is possible to partition this set into two subsets $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that each element of $U$ is included in exactly one of the subsets and the sum of the elements in $S_1$ is equal to the sum of the elements in $S_2$.

        For example, consider the set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. A possible partition meeting the criteria would be $S_1 = \{1, 4\}$ and $S_2 = \{2, 3\}$, since the sum of the elements in both subsets is 5, and every element of $U$ is present in either $S_1$ or $S_2$ exactly once. The Set Partition problem determines whether such a partition exists for a given set.
    \end{mdframed}

    Prove Set Partition (SP) is NP-Complete by reducing Subset Sum (SS) to Set Partition. %DO NOT reduce Set Partition to Subset Sum! This is simpler but does not prove Set Partition is NPC (and you will get a 0 on this problem if you do).

    \begin{parts}
        \part[5] Prove Set Partition is in NP (you shouldn't need more than a sentence or two).

        Set Partition is in NP because given a partition of the set, we can verify that the sum of the elements in each subset is equal.

        \part[10] Given the Subset Sum problem with a set $U$ and a target sum $T$, identify the single element that needs to be added to $U$ to transform it into a valid instance of the Set Partition problem. What is this element and how does it facilitate the reduction? (one paragraph).

        The element that needs to be added to $U$ is $2T$. This element facilitates the reduction because it ensures that the sum of the elements in $U$ is even. This is important because the Set Partition problem requires that the sum of the elements in each subset is equal. By adding $2T$, we ensure that the sum of the elements in $U$ is even, which is a necessary condition for a valid partition.

        \part[25] Provide a comprehensive argument for the correctness of your reduction from the SS problem to the SP problem.

        To prove Set Partition (SP) is NP-Complete, we need to establish its NP-membership and NP-hardness. We've already shown SP is in NP. To prove NP-hardness, we reduce Subset Sum (SS) to SP. Given an SS instance with set $U$ and target sum $T$, we add $2T$ to $U$ to ensure an even sum. If there's a subset $S \subseteq U$ with sum $T$, we partition $U$ into $S_1$ and $S_2$ with equal sums by adding $2T$. Conversely, if $U$ can be partitioned into $S_1$ and $S_2$ with equal sums, removing $2T$ yields a subset $S$ with sum $T$. Thus, SS reduces to SP, proving SP is NP-hard. Since SP is in NP and NP-hard, it's NP-Complete.
